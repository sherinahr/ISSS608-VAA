The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\nThis take-home exercise will explore the demographic and financial characteristics of the city of Engagement using static and interactive statistical graphics methods. The data will be processed using the tidyverse family of packages and the visualisations developed using ggplot2 and its extensions.\nSpecifically, this exercise seeks to answer the following using Exploratory & Confirmatory Data Analysis: What influences happiness?\n\n\n\nTwo data sets in csv format are provided for the purpose of this exercise - Participants & Financial Journal.\n\n\nThis dataset contains information about the residents of City of Engagement that have agreed to participate in this study and comprises the following fields:\n\nData Fields - Participants.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nparticipantId (integer)\nUnique ID assigned to each participant\n\n\nhouseholdSize (integer)\nNumber of people in the household\n\n\nhaveKids (boolean)\nPresence of children in the household\n\n\nage (integer)\nParticipant’s age in years at the start of the study\n\n\neducationLevel\n(string factor)\nParticipant’s education level\n[Low, HighSchoolorCollege, Bachelors, Graduate]\n\n\ninterestGroup (char)\nCharacter representing the participant’s stated primary interest group [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J]\n\n\njoviality (float)\nValue ranging from [0,1] indicating the participant’s overall happiness level at the start of the study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains information about the residents of City of Engagement that have agreed to participate in this study and comprises the following fields:\n\nData Fields - FinancialJournal.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nparticipantId (integer)\nUnique ID assigned to each participant\n\n\ntimestamp (datetime)\nTime when the check-in was logged\n\n\ncategory\n(string factor)\nString describing the expense category\n[Education, Food, Recreation, RentAdjustment, Shelter, Wage]\n\n\namount (double)\nAmount of the transaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few data quality issues with the datasets:\n\nThe timestamp information in the FinancialJournal.csv is too granular and should be changed to reflect the month and year instead.\nA quick analysis showed that there were duplicates in the data; these will be removed to ensure the data will not be skewed.\nThe quick analysis also highlighted that there were some participants who did not have entries for all 6 months; it is possible that they are no longer residents of the City. Since the aim of this exercise is to explore the financial trends of the residents, these participants will be removed.\nThe data is on an individual level and thus will be aggregated accordingly for the analyses.\nThe data types have to be checked as well.\nAfter addressing the above issues, the datasets should be combined to ensure a comprehensive and accurate analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is important to ensure that the datasets have been comprehensively cleaned prior to conducting analyses, to ensure our visualisations are accurate and informative!"

The mutate() function of dplyr is used to create a new variable called Age_Category while preserving the existing variable of age.\n\n\nShow code\nppt <- ppt %>%\n  mutate(Age_Category=cut(age, \n                          breaks=c(17, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60),\n                          labels=c('20 & Below', '21-30', '31-40', \n                                   '41-50', '51 and above')))\n\n# Check if the ages are reflected correctly\nhead(ppt$age)\nhead(ppt$Age_Category)\n\n\nNext, a few of the columns were not set to the appropriate data type. For example, participantID should be categorical but it shows as a continuous numeric variable. Further, we would need the education level to be read as an ordinal factor as there are levels for education. As above, the mutate() function will be used to update the data types.\n\n\nShow code\nppt <- ppt %>% mutate(participantId = as.factor(participantId))\nppt <- ppt %>% mutate(educationLevel = factor(educationLevel, \n                                              levels=c(\"Low\", \"HighSchoolOrCollege\", \"Bachelors\", \"Graduate\")))\n\n# Check data types\nstr(ppt)\n\n\nLastly, we will rename the other columns for nicer formatting and ease of reading with the below code chunk. As we are not making changes to the values, the column names will be amended in place.\n\n\nShow code\nppt <- ppt %>%\n  rename('ParticipantID' = 'participantId', \n         'HouseholdSize' = 'householdSize', \n         'EducationLevel' = 'educationLevel', \n         'InterestGroup' = 'interestGroup', \n         'Joviality' = 'joviality',\n         'HaveKids' = 'haveKids')\n\n# Check if the changes are reflected correctly\ncolnames(ppt)\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 FinancialJournal Dataset\nAs stated in section 1.2.3 Challenges, there are a number of issues with the dataset.\nFirstly, the data type for participantId was changed as above.\n\n\nShow code\nfj <- fj %>% mutate(participantId = as.factor(participantId))\n\n# Check data types\nstr(fj)\n\n\nNext, there are some duplicate rows in the dataset which have to be removed using the distinct() function. As the code below shows, there were 1,113 duplicate rows in the FinancialJournal dataset.\n\n\nShow code\nfj_2 <- fj %>% distinct()\nnrow(fj) - nrow(fj_2)\n\n\n[1] 1113\n\n\nNext, there were some participants who did not have entries for all 6 months. To find the these participants, first the data was grouped by the participantId. Examination of the results show that there are 131 participants which have lower than 1,000 transactions.\n\n\nShow code\nfj_2 %>%\n  group_by(participantId) %>%\n  summarize(transaction_count = n()) %>%\n  arrange(transaction_count)\n\n\nThe code chunk below will filter out these 131 participants. The data frame fj_final now has no duplicates, and only residents who still live in City of Engagement.\n\n\nShow code\nfj_final <- subset(fj_2, with(fj_2, participantId %in% \n                            names(which(table(participantId)>=1000))))\nhead(fj_final)\n\n\nNext, we would want to convert all of the timestamp data into Month-Year format for ease of comparison using the first line of code. However, the result would be in character format which is not advisable for analysis, and so we will run the subsequent line of code to change it to Date format.\n\n\nShow code\nfj_final <- fj_final %>%\n  mutate (Year_month = as.yearmon(timestamp))\n\nfj_final <- transform(fj_final, Year_month = as.Date(Year_month, frac = 0))\n\nhead(fj_final)\n\n\n  participantId  timestamp  category     amount Year_month\n1             0 2022-03-01      Wage 2472.50756 2022-03-01\n2             0 2022-03-01   Shelter -554.98862 2022-03-01\n3             0 2022-03-01 Education  -38.00538 2022-03-01\n4             1 2022-03-01      Wage 2046.56221 2022-03-01\n5             1 2022-03-01   Shelter -554.98862 2022-03-01\n6             1 2022-03-01 Education  -38.00538 2022-03-01\n\n\nFurther, most of the values are negative as they reflect expenditures for food, education, recreation and shelter. The positive amounts are for wage and rent adjustment. The data will also be changed from long to wide format for easier reading using the pivot_wider() function.\n\n\nShow code\nfj_final$amount <- abs(fj_final$amount)\nfj_final$amount <- round(fj_final$amount,digits=0)\n\nfj_wide <- fj_final %>%\n  group_by(participantId, Year_month, category) %>%\n  summarise(Total = sum(amount)) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = Total)\n\n# Replace NA values with 0 for Rent Adjustment\nfj_wide[is.na(fj_wide)] <- 0\n\nhead(fj_wide)\n\n\nTo find out the cost of living and total income of the residents, the values of the expenses for the four categories, and the wage and rent adjustment will be summed up respectively. We will also derive the total savings i.e. Total income - Cost of living.\n\n\nShow code\nfj_wide$Cost_of_living <- fj_wide$Education + \n  fj_wide$Food + fj_wide$Recreation + \n  fj_wide$Shelter\n\nfj_wide$Total_Income <- fj_wide$Wage + \n  fj_wide$RentAdjustment\n\nfj_wide$Total_Savings <- fj_wide$Total_Income - fj_wide$Cost_of_living\n\n\nLastly, we will rename the participantId column in place for consistency.\n\n\nShow code\nfj_wide <- fj_wide %>%\n  rename('ParticipantID' = 'participantId')\n\n# Check if the changes are reflected correctly\ncolnames(fj_wide)\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Combining the Datasets\nNow that data cleaning is done, let’s merge the datasets! We need to ensure that for the participants.csv, we only keep the distinct participants that were in our fj_wide csv. Let’s see what the final dataset looks like with the following code chunk.\n\n\nShow code\nmerged <- merge(fj_wide, ppt, by = \"ParticipantID\", all.x = TRUE)\n\nfinal <- subset(merged, ParticipantID %in% fj_wide$ParticipantID)\n\nDT::datatable(final, class = \"compact\")"

    "text": "Key Takeaways\nThe analyses have provided the following key takeaways:\n\nThe residents are quite evenly distributed in terms of age and household size. Most of the residents have at least high school or college education, and tend to have nuclear households.\nIn terms of financial health, it is possible that most residents are just getting by, as most residents earn below $3,000 and yet experience a cost of living of about half their income. Majority of their expenses are spent on shelter.\nInterestingly, residents who earned and saved more had lower scores for happiness than those who spent more. It is possible that residents who spent more are doing so on pursuits which bring them greater joy. There was also no difference in trend amongst different age groups.\nResidents with higher levels of education (Bachelors & Graduate) tended to be happier than those who had at least high school or college education.\nResidents tended to experience a dip in happiness as they age, though the dip is not severe and thus not a cause for concern.\nMarital status and having children did not have any influence on happiness level.\n\nOfficials may wish to conduct more life courses for the residents on topics such as financial planning, mental health and wellness programmes, and ensure that older residents are able to engage in activities and social support which can ensure their mental health and therefore improve their happiness as they continue to age."

Financial: Distribution of Total Income & Cost of Living\nThe line charts below show us an overview of the proportion of residents for the total income (as defined by the sum of wages and rent adjustment) and the cost of living. Both distributions are positively skewed i.e., mean is greater than the median. Majority of the residents have a total income of below $3,000 approximately, and have a cost of living of lower than $2,000.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Plot Total Income\ngg1<- ggplot(data=final, \n       aes(x = Total_Income)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"turquoise\",linewidth=1)+\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) +\n  labs(x= \"Wage\",y= \"Density\",title=\"Distribution of Total Income\") \n\n#Plot Total Cost of Living\ngg2<- ggplot(data=final, \n       aes(x = Cost_of_living)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"skyblue1\",linewidth=1)+\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank())+\n  labs(x= \"Cost of Living\",y= \"Density\",title=\"Distribution of Cost of Living\") \n\ngg1 / gg2\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s look at the trend of the total income and cost of living across the months using the animated graph below. We can see that primarily, monthly expenditures were fairly stable across months. As for total income, there was a spike in March 2022, but then returned to baseline amounts thereafter.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Change the ppt ID to numeric for continuous scale\np3 <- ggplot(final %>% mutate(ParticipantID = as.numeric(ParticipantID)),\n       aes(x = Total_Income, y = Cost_of_living, \n           size = Total_Income, \n           colour = ParticipantID)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(100)) +\n  scale_size(range = c(1, 6)) +\n  labs(title = 'Date: {frame_time}', \n       x = 'Total Income ($)',\n       y = 'Cost of Living ($)') +\n  transition_time(Year_month) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  ease_aes('linear')\n\n#Specify to animate within a specified duration\nanimate(p3, duration =20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Financial: Patterns of Cost of Living\nNow that we have seen the general trend of the total income and expenditures, let’s look at the patterns of cost of living. As we need the long format, we will first create a new table called Expenses from the fj_final table so as to isolate the specific expenditure categories.\n\n\nShow code\n#Create a Total column in fj_final and rename the dataframe\nfj_final2 <- fj_final %>%\n  group_by(participantId, Year_month, category) %>%\n  summarise(Total = sum(amount))\n\n#Create a new dataframe just for expenses\nexpenses <- fj_final2 %>%\n  filter(category != 'Wage') %>%\n  filter(category != 'RentAdjustment')\n\n#Check the values\nhead(expenses)\n\n\nWe can see from the boxplot below that most of the monthly expenditure was spent on shelter, followed by recreation, food, and lastly education.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = expenses,\n       aes(x = category, y = Total, fill = category))+\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  xlab(\"Category of Expenditure\") +\n  ylab(\"Amount ($)\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Monthly Expenses\") +\n  theme_classic() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Pastel2\")"

We will then determine what tests to carry out for our confirmatory data analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe need to test the normality assumption as it determines if we will use parametric or non-parametric methods for our statistical tests.

However, how you spend, save, and think about money shapes how much joy you get from it.\nIn this vein, let’s explore if the financial health - income, savings, and expenditures - influences the happiness of residents in the City using correlation. Logically, the more income you earn, more savings you have, and less expenditures you have, should result in higher happiness. It will be interesting to assess if the age of the resident matters as well. It is possible that the older residents would tend to have higher income (due to experience), more savings, and more expenditures.\nHowever, the correlation plots below shows otherwise:\n\nFor income, there seems to be a negative trend for all age groups i.e. higher income is negatively correlated with lower joviality scores.\nFor savings, the same trend persists - a negative trend for all age groups i.e. higher savings is negatively correlated with lower joviality scores.\nFor cost of living, there is an unexpected positive trend for all age groups i.e. higher expenses is positively correlated with higher joviality scores.\n\n\nIncomeSavingsCostsCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Mapping correlation of Joviality & Average Monthly Income\np4 <- plot_ly(data = joviality, x = ~Joviality, y = ~Avg_MonthlyIncome, size = ~Avg_MonthlyIncome, \n               color = ~Age_Category) %>%\n    layout(title = '<b> Correlation: Joviality and Income <b>', xaxis = list(title = 'Joviality Index'), yaxis = list(title = 'Average Income'), legend = list(title=list(text='<b> Age Category </b>')))\n\np4\n\n#Mapping correlation of Joviality & Average Monthly Savings\np5 <- plot_ly(data = joviality, x = ~Joviality, y = ~Avg_MonthlySavings, size = ~Avg_MonthlySavings, \n               color = ~Age_Category) %>%\n    layout(title = '<b> Correlation: Joviality and Savings <b>', xaxis = list(title = 'Joviality Index'), yaxis = list(title = 'Average Savings'), legend = list(title=list(text='<b> Age Category </b>')))\n\np5\n\n#Mapping correlation of Joviality & Average Monthly Expenditures\np6 <- plot_ly(data = joviality, x = ~Joviality, y = ~Avg_MonthlyCosts, size = ~Avg_MonthlyCosts, \n               color = ~Age_Category) %>%\n    layout(title = '<b> Correlation: Joviality and Cost of Living <b>', xaxis = list(title = 'Joviality Index'), yaxis = list(title = 'Average Costs'), legend = list(title=list(text='<b> Age Category </b>')))\n\np6\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation test for the above trends are significant, indicating that the trends are statistically significant. If we go back to the Harvard Business Review’s findings, it is possible that residents are indeed spending their money in ways that make them happy, and thus cost of living is positively correlated with joviality scores, and this is statistically significant.\n\nIncomeSavingsCostsCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Statistical Test of Joviality & Average Monthly Income Correlation\nggscatterstats(\n  data = joviality,\n  x = Joviality,\n  y = Avg_MonthlyIncome,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  ) + \nggtitle(\"Joviality and Average Income\") +\nlabs(x = \"Joviality Index\", y = \"Average Income\") +\ntheme_classic()\n\n#Statistical Test of Joviality & Average Monthly Savings Correlation\nggscatterstats(\n  data = joviality,\n  x = Joviality,\n  y = Avg_MonthlySavings,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  ) + \nggtitle(\"Joviality and Average Savings\") +\nlabs(x = \"Joviality Index\", y = \"Average Savings\") +\ntheme_classic()\n\n#Statistical Test of Joviality & Average Monthly Expenditures Correlation\nggscatterstats(\n  data = joviality,\n  x = Joviality,\n  y = Avg_MonthlyCosts,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  ) + \nggtitle(\"Joviality and Average Cost of Living\") +\nlabs(x = \"Joviality Index\", y = \"Average Cost of Living\") +\ntheme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Education and Age influence Happiness?\nIn 2016, the Time Magazine reported that older people tend to be happier than young adults, as they are much better able to brush off life’s small stressors and accumulate a valuable thing called wisdom: being emotionally stable and compassionate, knowing yourself and being able to make smart social decisions. A year earlier, Time also published a report stating that there is no link between education level and happiness. It will be interesting to see if these two trends hold true for residents in the City.\n\nEducation and Happiness\nSince the variable joviality did not meet the normality assumption, the non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test was conducted to find if mean joviality scores differed between different levels of education. As shown below, the p-value of the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test is 0.0036. We can conclude that mean joviality scores differed significantly across the four education levels. Specifically, High School or College education level differed significantly from Bachelors and Graduate. The mean joviality score of Bachelors and Graduate was higher than that of High School or College, indicating that the higher the level of education, the happier you are.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#np denotes non-parametric test\nggbetweenstats(data = joviality, x = EducationLevel, y = Joviality,\n               xlab = \"Education level\", ylab = \"Joviality Index\",\n               type = \"np\", pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, pairwise.display = \"s\",\n               mean.ci = T, p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",  conf.level = 0.95,\n               title = \"Comparison of Mean Joviality index across Education Levels\") + \n  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9)) +\n  theme_classic() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge and Happiness\nIn our revamped Joviality dataset, age exists as a categorical and continuous variable. It will be interesting to see if there is a difference in our analyses for both. As the plot shows, though age is negatively correlated with joviality scores and it is statistically significant, it is a very weak correlation of only -0.07. Age as a categorical variable did not have any significant influence on joviality scores, with p-value > 0.05. Age as a continuous variable had a negative influence on joviality scores.\n\nAge (Continuous)Age CategoryCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Age as a Continuous Variable\nggscatterstats(\n  data = joviality,\n  x = Joviality,\n  y = age,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  ) + \nggtitle(\"Joviality and Age\") +\nlabs(x = \"Joviality Index\", y = \"Age\") \n\n#Age as a Categorical Variable\nggbetweenstats(data = joviality, x = Age_Category, y = Joviality,\n               xlab = \"Age Category\", ylab = \"Joviality Index\",\n               type = \"np\", pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, pairwise.display = \"s\",\n               mean.ci = T, p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",  conf.level = 0.95,\n               sort = \"ascending\",\n               title = \"Comparison of Mean Joviality index across Age Groups\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 2)) +\n  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9)) +\n  theme_classic() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Marital Status and Having Kids Influence Happiness?\nGoing back to Time magazine, it reported that a study of the life satisfaction of 22 Western countries found that in many countries, parents were happier than non-parents, except for the US.\nTherefore in our final analysis, we will explore if marital status and having children influences happiness. Since all residents with a household size of 3 also satisfied the condition of true for the variable HaveKids, we will use household size as a proxy variable for marital status i.e., 1 = single, 2 = married, 3 = married with a child.\nThe plot shows that for singles, there seems to be 2 main humps at Joviality scores of 0.2 and 0.9 i.e. singles experience a varying range of happiness with some being happier than others. For majority of the married couples and those with children, joviality scores tend to be lower.\nThe Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was non-significant with a p-value > 0.05, indicating that joviality was not influenced by marital status and having children.\n\nPlotStatistical TestCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Plot a ridgeline graph\nggplot(joviality, \n       aes(x = Joviality, \n           y = HouseholdSize,\n           fill = after_stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Joviality index\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Joviality\",\n                       option = \"G\")\n\n#Non-parametric Statistical Test\nggbetweenstats(data = joviality, x = HouseholdSize, y = Joviality,\n               xlab = \"Marital Status\", ylab = \"Joviality Index\",\n               type = \"np\", pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, pairwise.display = \"s\",\n               mean.ci = T, p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",  conf.level = 0.95,\n               title = \"Comparison of Mean Joviality index across Marital Status\") + \n  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9)) +\n  theme_classic()"

    "text": "5.3 Creating network objects using tidygraph\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow. Before getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\nA tidy hope\n\n\n5.3.1 The tbl_graph object\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 The dplyr verbs in tidygraph\nThe activate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\nIn the above image, the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n5.3.3 Using tbl_graph() to build tidygraph data model\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph().\n\n\nShow code\nGAStech_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Reviewing the output tidygraph’s graph object\n\n\nShow code\nGAStech_graph\n\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# A tibble: 54 × 4\n     id label               Department     Title                                \n  <dbl> <chr>               <chr>          <chr>                                \n1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                     \n2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                     \n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                     \n4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                     \n5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Manag…\n6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager        \n# ℹ 48 more rows\n#\n# A tibble: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  <int> <int> <ord>    <int>\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 1372 edges. The command also prints the first six rows of the node data and the first three rows of edge data. It states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n5.3.5 Changing the active object\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange(), for example as below. Visit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function.\n\n\nShow code\nGAStech_graph %>%\n  activate(edges) %>%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# A tibble: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday  Weight\n  <int> <int> <ord>     <int>\n1    40    41 Saturday     13\n2    41    43 Monday       11\n3    35    31 Tuesday      10\n4    40    41 Monday       10\n5    40    43 Monday       10\n6    36    32 Sunday        9\n# ℹ 1,366 more rows\n#\n# A tibble: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  <dbl> <chr>           <chr>          <chr>           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows"

    "text": "5.4 Plotting Static Network Graphs with ggraph package\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs. As in all network graphs, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges, and\nlayouts.\n\n\n5.4.1 Plotting a basic network graph\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\n\nShow code\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\n\n\nThe basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Changing the default network graph theme\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read its reference guide at least once.\n\n\nShow code\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\n\n\n\nggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden).\nThe ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Changing the coloring of the plot\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\n\nShow code\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Working with ggraph’s layouts\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n \n\n\n5.4.5 Fruchterman and Reingold layout\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout. The layout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\nShow code\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.6 Modifying network nodes\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments. The geom_node_point is equivalent in functionality to geo_point of ggplot2. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chunks above colour and size are used.\n\n\nShow code\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.7 Modifying edges\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable. The geom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n\n\nShow code\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()"

In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data. There are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\n\n5.5.1 Working with facet_edges()\nIn the code chunk below, facet_edges() is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\n\nShow code\nset_graph_style()\n\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n\ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses theme() to change the position of the legend.\n\n\nShow code\nset_graph_style()\n\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.2 A framed facet graph\nThe code chunk below adds frame to each graph.\n\n\nShow code\nset_graph_style() \n\ng <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday) +\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Working with facet_nodes()\nIn the code chunkc below, facet_nodes() is used.

There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. It is beyond the scope of this hands-on exercise to cover the principles and mathematics of these measure here. Students are encouraged to refer to Chapter 7: Actor Prominence of A User’s Guide to Network Analysis in R to gain better understanding of these network measures.\n\n\nShow code\ng <- GAStech_graph %>%\n  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %>%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department,\n            size=betweenness_centrality))\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nmutate() of dplyr is used to perform the computation.\nThe algorithm used, on the other hand, is the centrality_betweenness() of tidygraph.\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Visualising network metrics\nIt is important to note that from ggraph v2.0 onward tidygraph algorithms such as centrality measures can be accessed directly in ggraph calls. This means that it is no longer necessary to precompute and store derived node and edge centrality measures on the graph in order to use them in a plot.\n\n\nShow code\ng <- GAStech_graph %>%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = centrality_betweenness()))\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.3 Visualising Community\ntidygraph package inherits many of the community detection algorithms imbedded into igraph and makes them available to us, including Edge-betweenness (group_edge_betweenness), Leading eigenvector (group_leading_eigen), Fast-greedy (group_fast_greedy), Louvain (group_louvain), Walktrap (group_walktrap), Label propagation (group_label_prop), InfoMAP (group_infomap), Spinglass (group_spinglass), and Optimal (group_optimal). Some community algorithms are designed to take into account direction or weight, while others ignore it.

A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\nThis take-home exercise will explore the demographic and financial characteristics of the city of Engagement using static and interactive statistical graphics methods. The data will be processed using the tidyverse family of packages and the visualisations developed using ggplot2 and its extensions.\nSpecifically, this exercise seeks to fulfill the following objectives:\n\nProvide an understanding of the demographics of the City of Engagement;\nExplore the factors influencing joviality index;\nExamine the relationship between income and cost of living; and\nExplore the factors influencing income.\n\n\n\n\nTwo data sets in csv format are provided for the purpose of this exercise - Participants & Financial Journal.\n\n\nThis dataset contains information about the residents of City of Engagement that have agreed to participate in this study and comprises the following fields:\n\nData Fields - Participants.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nparticipantId (integer)\nUnique ID assigned to each participant\n\n\nhouseholdSize (integer)\nNumber of people in the household\n\n\nhaveKids (boolean)\nPresence of children in the household\n\n\nage (integer)\nParticipant’s age in years at the start of the study\n\n\neducationLevel\n(string factor)\nParticipant’s education level\n[Low, HighSchoolorCollege, Bachelors, Graduate]\n\n\ninterestGroup (char)\nCharacter representing the participant’s stated primary interest group [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J]\n\n\njoviality (float)\nValue ranging from [0,1] indicating the participant’s overall happiness level at the start of the study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains information about the residents of City of Engagement that have agreed to participate in this study and comprises the following fields:\n\nData Fields - FinancialJournal.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nparticipantId (integer)\nUnique ID assigned to each participant\n\n\ntimestamp (datetime)\nTime when the check-in was logged\n\n\ncategory\n(string factor)\nString describing the expense category\n[Education, Food, Recreation, RentAdjustment, Shelter, Wage]\n\n\namount (double)\nAmount of the transaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few data quality issues with the datasets:\n\nThe timestamp information in the FinancialJournal.csv is too granular and should be changed to reflect the month and year instead.\nA quick analysis showed that there were duplicates in the data; these will be removed to ensure the data will not be skewed.\nThe quick analysis also highlighted that there were some participants who did not have entries for all 6 months; it is possible that they are no longer residents of the City. Since the aim of this exercise is to explore the financial trends of the residents, these participants will be removed.\nThe data is on an individual level and thus will be aggregated accordingly for the analyses.\nAfter addressing the above issues, the datasets will be combined to ensure a comprehensive and accurate analysis."

The mutate() function of dplyr is used to create a new variable called Age_Category while preserving the existing variable of age.\n\nppt <- ppt %>%\n  mutate(Age_Category=cut(age, \n                          breaks=c(17, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60),\n                          labels=c('20 & Below', '21-30', '31-40', \n                                   '41-50', '51 and above')))\n\n# Check if the ages are reflected correctly\nhead(ppt$age)\n\n[1] 36 25 35 21 43 32\n\nhead(ppt$Age_Category)\n\n[1] 31-40 21-30 31-40 21-30 41-50 31-40\nLevels: 20 & Below 21-30 31-40 41-50 51 and above\n\n\nThe other change is to make the field “haveKids” clearer. Currently, it reflects the boolean values of True/False. To ensure clarity and better understanding of our subsequent charts, the values will be changed to Yes/No, as reflected in the below code chunk. As above, the mutate() function will be used to create a new variable called Have_Kids.\n\nppt<-ppt %>%\n  mutate(Have_Kids = case_when(haveKids==TRUE ~ \"Yes\", haveKids==FALSE ~ \"No\"))\n\n# Check if the changes are reflected correctly\nhead(ppt$Have_Kids)\n\n[1] \"Yes\" \"Yes\" \"Yes\" \"Yes\" \"Yes\" \"Yes\"\n\n\nLastly, we will rename the other columns for nicer formatting and ease of reading with the below code chunk. As we are not making changes to the values, the column names will be amended in place.\n\nppt <- ppt %>%\n  rename('Participant_ID' = 'participantId', \n         'Household_Size' = 'householdSize', \n         'Education_Level' = 'educationLevel', \n         'Interest_Group' = 'interestGroup', \n         'Joviality' = 'joviality')\n\n# Check if the changes are reflected correctly\ncolnames(ppt)\n\n[1] \"Participant_ID\"  \"Household_Size\"  \"haveKids\"        \"age\"            \n[5] \"Education_Level\" \"Interest_Group\"  \"Joviality\"       \"Age_Category\"   \n[9] \"Have_Kids\"      \n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 FinancialJournal Dataset\nAs stated in section 1.2.3 Challenges, there are a number of issues with the dataset.\nFirstly, there are some duplicate rows in the dataset which have to be removed using the distinct() function. As the code below shows, there were 1,113 duplicate rows in the FinancialJournal dataset.\n\nfj_2 <- fj %>% distinct()\nnrow(fj) - nrow(fj_2)\n\n[1] 1113\n\n\nNext, there were some participants who did not have entries for all 6 months. To find the these participants, first the data was grouped by the Participant_ID. Examination of the results show that there are 131 participants which have lower than 1,000 transactions.\n\nfj_2 %>%\n  group_by(participantId) %>%\n  summarize(transaction_count = n()) %>%\n  arrange(transaction_count)\n\nThe code chunk below will filter out these 131 participants and tell us how many rows were removed. The data frame fj_final now has no duplicates, and only residents who still live in City of Engagement.\n\nfj_final <- subset(fj_2, with(fj_2, participantId %in% \n                            names(which(table(participantId)>=1000))))\n\nNext, we would want to convert all of the timestamp data into Month-Year format for ease of comparison using the code chunk below.\n\nfj_final <- fj_final %>%\n  mutate (Year_month = as.yearmon(timestamp)) \n\nhead(fj_final)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  participantId timestamp           category  amount Year_month\n          <dbl> <dttm>              <chr>      <dbl> <yearmon> \n1             0 2022-03-01 00:00:00 Wage      2473.  Mar 2022  \n2             0 2022-03-01 00:00:00 Shelter   -555.  Mar 2022  \n3             0 2022-03-01 00:00:00 Education  -38.0 Mar 2022  \n4             1 2022-03-01 00:00:00 Wage      2047.  Mar 2022  \n5             1 2022-03-01 00:00:00 Shelter   -555.  Mar 2022  \n6             1 2022-03-01 00:00:00 Education  -38.0 Mar 2022  \n\n\nFurther, most of the values are negative as they reflect expenditures for food, education, recreation and shelter. The positive amounts are for wage and rent adjustment. The data will also be changed from long to wide format for easier reading using the pivot_wider() function.\n\nfj_final$amount <- abs(fj_final$amount)\nfj_final$amount <- round(fj_final$amount,digits=0)\n\nfj_final_by_year <- fj_final %>%\n  group_by(participantId, category,Year_month) %>%\n  summarise(Total = sum(amount))\n\nfj_final_by_year <- pivot_wider(\n  fj_final_by_year,names_from = category,values_from =Total)\n\n# Replace NA values with 0 for Rent Adjustment\nfj_final_by_year[is.na(fj_final_by_year)] <- 0\n\nTo find out the cost of living and total income of the residents, the values of the expenses for the four categories, and the wage and rent adjustment will be summed up respectively. We will also derive the total savings i.e. Total income - Cost of living.\n\nfj_final_by_year$Cost_of_living <- fj_final_by_year$Education + \n  fj_final_by_year$Food + fj_final_by_year$Recreation + \n  fj_final_by_year$Shelter\n\nfj_final_by_year$Total_Income <- fj_final_by_year$Wage + \n  fj_final_by_year$RentAdjustment\n\nfj_final_by_year$Total_Savings <- fj_final_by_year$Total_Income - fj_final_by_year$Cost_of_living\n\nhead(fj_final_by_year)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n# Groups:   participantId [1]\n  participantId Year_month Education  Food Recreation Shelter  Wage\n          <dbl> <yearmon>      <dbl> <dbl>      <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>\n1             0 Mar 2022          38   269        348     555 11926\n2             0 Apr 2022          38   269        219     555  8631\n3             0 May 2022          38   264        384     555  9042\n4             0 Jun 2022          38   257        466     555  9042\n5             0 Jul 2022          38   270       1069     555  8631\n6             0 Aug 2022          38   260        313     555  9453\n# ℹ 4 more variables: RentAdjustment <dbl>, Cost_of_living <dbl>,\n#   Total_Income <dbl>, Total_Savings <dbl>\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Combining the Datasets"

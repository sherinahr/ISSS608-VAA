# Part 1: Visualising Uncertainty

Visualising uncertainty is relatively new in statistical graphics. In this chapter, we will gain hands-on experience on creating statistical graphics for visualising uncertainty. By the end of this chapter we will be able to:

-   plot statistics error bars by using ggplot2,

-   plot interactive error bars by combining ggplot2, plotly and DT,

-   create advanced by using ggdist, and

-   create hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) by using ungeviz package.

## Getting Started

For the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:

-   tidyverse, a family of R packages for data science process
-   plotly for creating interactive plot
-   gganimate for creating animation plot
-   DT for displaying interactive html table
-   crosstalk for for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering), and
-   ggdist for visualising distribution and uncertainty.

### Installing and loading the packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(plotly, crosstalk,
               DT, ggdist, ggridges,
               colorspace, gganimate, tidyverse)
```

### Importing the Data

For the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods

A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval.

::: callout-important
Don't confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate with the variation in the sample!
:::

In this section, we will learn how to plot error bars of maths scores by race by using data provided in the exam tibble data frame. Firstly, code chunk below will be used to derive the necessary summary statistics. Things to note:

-   group_by() of dplyr package is used to group the observation by RACE
-   summarise() is used to compute the count of observations, mean, standard deviation
-   mutate() is used to derive the standard error of Maths by RACE, and
-   the output is saved as a tibble data table called my_sum.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
my_sum <- exam %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(MATHS),
    sd=sd(MATHS)
    ) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
```

Next, the code chunk below will be used to display my_sum tibble data frame in an html table format.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')
```

### Plotting standard error bars of point estimates

Now we are ready to plot the standard error bars of mean maths score by race as shown below.

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false 

ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=RACE, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean maths score by Race")
```

## Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false

ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=RACE, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean maths score by Race")
```

### Plotting confidence interval of point estimates

Instead of plotting the standard error bar of point estimates, we can also plot the confidence intervals of mean maths score by race.

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false 

ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), 
        ymin=mean-1.96*se, 
        ymax=mean+1.96*se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  labs(x = "Maths score",
       title = "95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race")
```

## Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false

ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), 
        ymin=mean-1.96*se, 
        ymax=mean+1.96*se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  labs(x = "Maths score",
       title = "95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars

In this section, we will learn how to plot interactive error bars for the 99% confidence interval of mean maths score by race as shown in the figure below.

## Visualising Uncertainty: ggdist package

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.

It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:

-   for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette("freq-uncertainty-vis"));

-   for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).

![](Image1.png)

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: stat_pointinterval()

In the code chunk below, [`stat_pointinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_pointinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race. Note that this function comes with many arguments, and one is advised to read the syntax reference for more details.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval() +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

For example, in the code chunk below the following arguments are used:

-   .width = 0.95

-   .point = median

-   .interval = qi

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,
  .point = median,
  .interval = qi) +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of median math score",
    subtitle = "Median Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: stat_gradientinterval()

In the code chunk below, [stat_gradientinterval()](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_gradientinterval.html) of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_gradientinterval(   
    fill = "skyblue",      
    show.legend = TRUE     
  ) +                        
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Gradient + interval plot")
```

## Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)

Step 1: Installing ungeviz package

```{r}
devtools::install_github("wilkelab/ungeviz")
```

Step 2: Launch the application in R

```{r}
library(ungeviz)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), 
            y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3, 
    width = 0.05), 
    size = 0.4, 
    color = "#0072B2", 
    alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, 
                             group = RACE), 
              height = 0.6, 
              color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() + 
  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)
```

# Part 2: Building Funnel Plot with R

Funnel plot is a specially designed data visualisation for conducting unbiased comparison between outlets, stores or business entities. By the end of this hands-on exercise, we will gain hands-on experience on:

-   plotting funnel plots by using **funnelPlotR** package,

-   plotting static funnel plot by using ggplot2 package, and

-   plotting interactive funnel plot by using both **plotly R** and **ggplot2** packages.

## Getting Started

In this exercise, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   readr for importing csv into R
-   FunnelPlotR for creating funnel plots
-   ggplot2 for creating funnel plots manually
-   knitr for building static html tables and
-   plotly for creating interactive funnel plots

### Installing and loading the packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr)
```

### Importing the Data

In this section, COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta will be used. The data was downloaded from [Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta portal](https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/). For this hands-on exercise, we are going to compare the cumulative COVID-19 cases and death by sub-district (i.e. kelurahan) as at 31st July 2021, DKI Jakarta.

The code chunk below imports the data into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called *covid-19*.

```{r}
covid19 <- read_csv("data/COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta.csv") %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
knitr::kable(head(covid19), format = 'html')
```

## FunnelPlotR methods

[**FunnelPlotR**](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/FunnelPlotR/) package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a `numerator` (events of interest), `denominator` (population to be considered) and `group`. The key arguments selected for customisation are:

-   `limit`: plot limits (95 or 99)

-   `label_outliers`: to label outliers (true or false)

-   `Poisson_limits`: to add Poisson limits to the plot

-   `OD_adjust`: to add overdispersed limits to the plot

-   `xrange` and `yrange`: to specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function &

-   Other aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc

### FunnelPlotR methods: The basic plot

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot. Things to learn from the code chunk above:

-   group in this function is different from the scatterplot. Here, it defines the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If Cityc is chosen, there are only six data points.
-   By default, data_typeargument is "SR"
-   limit: Plot limits, accepted values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95% or 99.8% quantiles of the distribution.

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  numerator = covid19$Positive,
  denominator = covid19$Death,
  group = covid19$`Sub-district`
)
```

### FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1

Things to learn from the code chunk above:

-   data_type argument is used to change from default "SR" to "PR" (i.e. proportions)
-   xrange and yrange are used to set the range of x-axis and y-axis.

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  numerator = covid19$Death,
  denominator = covid19$Positive,
  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,
  data_type = "PR",     #<<
  xrange = c(0, 6500),  #<<
  yrange = c(0, 0.05)   #<<
)
```

### FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 2

Things to learn from the code chunk above:

-   label = NA argument is to removed the default label outliers feature
-   title argument is used to add plot title
-   x_label and y_label arguments are used to add/edit x-axis and y-axis titles

```{r}
funnel_plot(
  numerator = covid19$Death,
  denominator = covid19$Positive,
  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,
  data_type = "PR",   
  xrange = c(0, 6500),  
  yrange = c(0, 0.05),
  label = NA,
  title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<           
  x_label = "Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<
  y_label = "Cumulative Fatality Rate"  #<<
)
```

## Funnel Plot for Fair Visual Comparison: ggplot2 methods

In this section, we will gain hands-on experience on building funnel plots step-by-step by using ggplot2. It aims to enhance our working experience of ggplot2 to customise specialised data visualisations like funnel plots.

### Computing the basic derived fields

To plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive the cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.

```{r}
df <- covid19 %>%
  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %>%
  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %>%
  filter(rate > 0)
```

Next, the fit.mean is computed by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
fit.mean <- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)
```

### Calculate lower and upper limits for 95% and 99.9% CI

The code chunk below is used to compute the lower and upper limits for 95% confidence intervals.

```{r}
number.seq <- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)
number.ll95 <- fit.mean - 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ul95 <- fit.mean + 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ll999 <- fit.mean - 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ul999 <- fit.mean + 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
dfCI <- data.frame(number.ll95, number.ul95, number.ll999, 
                   number.ul999, number.seq, fit.mean)
```

### Plotting a static funnel plot

In the code chunk below, ggplot2 functions are used to plot a static funnel plot.

### Interactive Funnel Plot: plotly + ggplot2

The funnel plot created using ggplot2 functions can be made interactive with ggplotly() of plotly r package.

```{r}
fp_ggplotly <- ggplotly(p,
  tooltip = c("label", 
              "x", 
              "y"))
fp_ggplotly
```

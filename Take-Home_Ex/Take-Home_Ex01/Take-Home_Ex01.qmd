## **Overview**

### **1.1 Introduction**

City of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.

This take-home exercise will explore the demographic and financial characteristics of the city of Engagement using static and interactive statistical graphics methods. The data will be processed using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of packages and the visualisations developed using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html) and its extensions.

Specifically, this exercise seeks to answer the following using Exploratory & Confirmatory Data Analysis: **What influences happiness?**

### **1.2 The Data**

: Data Fields - FinancialJournal.csv

#### **1.2.3 Challenges with the Datasets**

There are a few data quality issues with the datasets:

1.  The timestamp information in the FinancialJournal.csv is too granular and should be changed to reflect the month and year instead.

2.  A quick analysis showed that there were duplicates in the data; these will be removed to ensure the data will not be skewed.

3.  The quick analysis also highlighted that there were some participants who did not have entries for all 6 months; it is possible that they are no longer residents of the City. Since the aim of this exercise is to explore the financial trends of the residents, these participants will be removed.

4.  The data is on an individual level and thus will be aggregated accordingly for the analyses.

5.  The data types have to be checked as well.

6.  After addressing the above issues, the datasets should be combined to ensure a comprehensive and accurate analysis.

## **Data Preparation**

### **2.1 Install and Launch R packages**

In this exercise, the following packages will be used: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, patchwork, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, and ggrepel. The codechunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto the working R environment:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(patchwork, ggplot2, dplyr, rstatix, gt,
               gganimate, gifski, png, zoo, DT, ggjoy,
               tidyverse, ggstatsplot, plotly) 
```

### **2.2 Import Datasets**

The code chunk below imports the datasets into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package as part of tidyverse.

```{r}
ppt <-read_csv("data/Participants.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
fj <- read_csv("data/FinancialJournal.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

The summary and spec() function is used to provide an overview of the central tendencies, and data types of the datasets.

```{r}
summary(ppt)
spec(ppt)
```

```{r}
summary(fj)
spec(fj)
```

### **2.3 Data Wrangling**

#### **2.3.1 Participants Dataset**

There are a few data quality issues:

Firstly, the age variable is binned with the following code chunk. The mutate() function of dplyr is used to create a new variable called Age_Category while preserving the existing variable of age.

```{r}
#| output: false

ppt <- ppt %>%
  mutate(Age_Category=cut(age, 
                          breaks=c(17, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60),
                          labels=c('20 & Below', '21-30', '31-40', 
                                   '41-50', '51 and above')))

# Check if the ages are reflected correctly
head(ppt$age)
head(ppt$Age_Category)

```

Next, a few of the columns were not set to the appropriate data type. For example, participantID should be categorical but it shows as a continuous numeric variable. Further, we would need the education level to be read as an ordinal factor as there are levels for education. As above, the mutate() function will be used to update the data types.

```{r}
#| output: false

ppt <- ppt %>% mutate(participantId = as.factor(participantId))
ppt <- ppt %>% mutate(educationLevel = factor(educationLevel, 
                                              levels=c("Low", "HighSchoolOrCollege", "Bachelors", "Graduate")))

# Check data types
str(ppt)

```

Lastly, we will rename the other columns for nicer formatting and ease of reading with the below code chunk. As we are not making changes to the values, the column names will be amended in place.

```{r}
#| output: false

ppt <- ppt %>%
  rename('ParticipantID' = 'participantId', 
         'HouseholdSize' = 'householdSize', 
         'EducationLevel' = 'educationLevel', 
         'InterestGroup' = 'interestGroup', 
         'Joviality' = 'joviality',
         'HaveKids' = 'haveKids')

# Check if the changes are reflected correctly
colnames(ppt)

```

#### **2.3.2 FinancialJournal Dataset**

As stated in section 1.2.3 Challenges, there are a number of issues with the dataset.

Firstly, the data type for participantId was changed as above.

```{r}
#| output: false

fj <- fj %>% mutate(participantId = as.factor(participantId))

# Check data types
str(fj)

```

Next, there are some duplicate rows in the dataset which have to be removed using the distinct() function. As the code below shows, there were 1,113 duplicate rows in the FinancialJournal dataset.

```{r}
fj_2 <- fj %>% distinct()
nrow(fj) - nrow(fj_2)
```

Next, there were some participants who did not have entries for all 6 months. To find the these participants, first the data was grouped by the participantId. Examination of the results show that there are 131 participants which have lower than 1,000 transactions.

```{r}
#| output: false

fj_2 %>%
  group_by(participantId) %>%
  summarize(transaction_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(transaction_count)
```

The code chunk below will filter out these 131 participants. The data frame fj_final now has no duplicates, and only residents who still live in City of Engagement.

```{r}
#| output: false
fj_final <- subset(fj_2, with(fj_2, participantId %in% 
                            names(which(table(participantId)>=1000))))
head(fj_final)
```

Next, we would want to convert all of the timestamp data into Month-Year format for ease of comparison using the first line of code. However, the result would be in character format which is not advisable for analysis, and so we will run the subsequent line of code to change it to Date format.

```{r}

fj_final <- fj_final %>%
  mutate (Year_month = as.yearmon(timestamp))

fj_final <- transform(fj_final, Year_month = as.Date(Year_month, frac = 0))

head(fj_final)

```

Further, most of the values are negative as they reflect expenditures for food, education, recreation and shelter. The positive amounts are for wage and [rent adjustment](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/rent-adjustment-amount). The data will also be changed from long to wide format for easier reading using the pivot_wider() function.

```{r}
#| output: false

fj_final$amount <- abs(fj_final$amount)
fj_final$amount <- round(fj_final$amount,digits=0)

fj_wide <- fj_final %>%
  group_by(participantId, Year_month, category) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(amount)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = Total)

# Replace NA values with 0 for Rent Adjustment
fj_wide[is.na(fj_wide)] <- 0

head(fj_wide)

```

To find out the cost of living and total income of the residents, the values of the expenses for the four categories, and the wage and rent adjustment will be summed up respectively. We will also derive the total savings i.e. Total income - Cost of living.

```{r}

fj_wide$Cost_of_living <- fj_wide$Education + 
  fj_wide$Food + fj_wide$Recreation + 
  fj_wide$Shelter

fj_wide$Total_Income <- fj_wide$Wage + 
  fj_wide$RentAdjustment

fj_wide$Total_Savings <- fj_wide$Total_Income - fj_wide$Cost_of_living

```

Lastly, we will rename the participantId column in place for consistency.

```{r}
#| output: false

fj_wide <- fj_wide %>%
  rename('ParticipantID' = 'participantId')

# Check if the changes are reflected correctly
colnames(fj_wide)

```

#### **2.3.3 Combining the Datasets**

Now that data cleaning is done, let's merge the datasets! We need to ensure that for the participants.csv, we only keep the distinct participants that were in our fj_wide csv. Let's see what the final dataset looks like with the following code chunk.

```{r}

merged <- merge(fj_wide, ppt, by = "ParticipantID", all.x = TRUE)

final <- subset(merged, ParticipantID %in% fj_wide$ParticipantID)

DT::datatable(final, class = "compact")

```

## **Demographic & Financial Profiles**

In this section, we will first take a quick look at the demographic and financial profile of the residents. Simple visualisations which show the distributions will be used, such as pie, line, and bar charts. Based on these, we will conduct confirmatory data analyses to assess what influences happiness.

### **3.1. Demographic: Age & Education**

The adult residents (aged 21 and above) are quite evenly distributed in the City. As for education level, almost half (48%) of the residents had at least high school or college education, and 45% had at least a Bachelor's degree.

### **3.2. Demographic: Household Size and Children**

Residents of the City tend to have nuclear households, with a maximum of 3 members in a household. From the pie chart, we can see that about one-third of the residents have children.

### **3.3. Financial: Distribution of Total Income & Cost of Living**

The line charts below show us an overview of the proportion of residents for the total income (as defined by the sum of wages and rent adjustment) and the cost of living. Both distributions are positively skewed i.e., mean is greater than the median. Majority of the residents have a total income of below \$3,000 approximately, and have a cost of living of lower than \$2,000.

Next, let's look at the trend of the total income and cost of living across the months using the animated graph below. We can see that primarily, monthly expenditures were fairly stable across months. As for total income, there was a spike in March 2022, but then returned to baseline amounts thereafter.

### **3.4 Financial: Patterns of Cost of Living**

Now that we have seen the general trend of the total income and expenditures, let's look at the patterns of cost of living. As we need the long format, we will first create a new table called Expenses from the fj_final table so as to isolate the specific expenditure categories.

```{r}
#| output: false

#Create a Total column in fj_final and rename the dataframe
fj_final2 <- fj_final %>%
  group_by(participantId, Year_month, category) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(amount))

#Create a new dataframe just for expenses
expenses <- fj_final2 %>%
  filter(category != 'Wage') %>%
  filter(category != 'RentAdjustment')

#Check the values
head(expenses)

```

We can see from the boxplot below that most of the monthly expenditure was spent on shelter, followed by recreation, food, and lastly education.

## **What influences Happiness?**

### **3.5. Joviality**

Now that we have finished exploring the demographic and financial characteristics, let's plot the distribution of joviality and assess if it meets the normality assumption. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used. If the p-value is significant, the variable is not normally distributed. We will then determine what tests to carry out for our confirmatory data analyses.

::: callout-important
We need to test the normality assumption as it determines if we will use parametric or non-parametric methods for our statistical tests. Using the wrong tests may result in erroneous results and conclusions!
:::

For the testing of normality assumption and CDA, we will transform the data to a format where each row will be equivalent to 1 resident using the below code chunk.

```{r}
joviality <- final %>%
  #To ungroup any variables if necessary
  ungroup() %>%
  #To select the columns as needed
  select(ParticipantID, Cost_of_living, Total_Income, Total_Savings, HouseholdSize,
         HaveKids, EducationLevel, InterestGroup, age, Age_Category, Joviality) %>% 
  group_by(ParticipantID, Joviality, HouseholdSize, HaveKids, EducationLevel, InterestGroup, age, Age_Category) %>% 
  #Calculate average financial information per participant across the 15 months
  summarise(across(c(Total_Income, Cost_of_living, Total_Savings), mean)) %>%
  rename("Avg_MonthlyIncome" = "Total_Income",
         "Avg_MonthlyCosts" = "Cost_of_living",
         "Avg_MonthlySavings" = "Total_Savings")

#Round values
joviality$Avg_MonthlyIncome <- round(joviality$Avg_MonthlyIncome,digits=0)
joviality$Avg_MonthlyCosts <- round(joviality$Avg_MonthlyCosts,digits=0)
joviality$Avg_MonthlySavings <- round(joviality$Avg_MonthlySavings,digits=0)

#Check output of data
DT::datatable(joviality, class = "compact")

```

#### Testing of Normality Assumption

As the plot below shows, p-value is less than 0.05 i.e., the distribution of joviality is not Normal and therefore non-parametric statistical tests must be used.

::: panel-tabset
### Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false 

#Plot QQplot for Joviality
qq <- ggplot(joviality,
       aes(sample=Joviality)) +  
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()

#Run the Shapiro Wilki test
sw_t <- shapiro_test(ppt$Joviality) %>% gt()   

#Create a temp table
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = '.png') 
# Save sw_t into tmp folder
gtsave(sw_t, tmp)  
table_png <- png::readPNG(tmp, native = TRUE)

qq+table_png
```

### Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false

#Plot QQplot for Joviality
qq <- ggplot(joviality,
       aes(sample=Joviality)) +  
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()

#Run the Shapiro Wilki test
sw_t <- shapiro_test(ppt$Joviality) %>% gt()   

#Create a temp table
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = '.png') 
# Save sw_t into tmp folder

#### Does Financial Health influence Happiness?

The Harvard Business Review published a [research](https://hbr.org/2020/09/does-more-money-really-makes-us-more-happy#:~:text=A%20mountain%20of%20evidence%20shows,joy%20you%20get%20from%20it.) that on average, wealthier people are happier. However, how you spend, save, and think about money shapes how much joy you get from it.

In this vein, let's explore if the financial health - income, savings, and expenditures - influences the happiness of residents in the City using correlation. Logically, the more income you earn, more savings you have, and less expenditures you have, should result in higher happiness. It will be interesting to assess if the age of the resident matters as well. It is possible that the older residents would tend to have higher income (due to experience), more savings, and more expenditures.

However, the correlation plots below shows otherwise:

-   For income, there seems to be a negative trend for all age groups i.e. higher income is negatively correlated with lower joviality scores. 
-   For savings, the same trend persists - a negative trend for all age groups i.e. higher savings is negatively correlated with lower joviality scores.
-   For cost of living, there is an unexpected negative trend for all age groups i.e. higher expenses is positively correlated with higher joviality scores.

The correlation test for the above trends are significant, indicating that the trends are statistically significant. If we go back to the Harvard Business Review's findings, it is possible that residents are indeed spending their money in ways that make them happy, and thus cost of living is positively correlated with joviality scores, and this is statistically significant.

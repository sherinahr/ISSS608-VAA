This Take-Home exercise is about network visualisation. 

## **1.1 The Dataset**

The dataset used is from the VAST Challenge 2023. Let's first load the packages and dataset to be used.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(jsonlite, tidygraph, ggraph, visNetwork, tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# The front part before :: is to load the package.

MC1 <- jsonlite::fromJSON("data/MC1.json")
```

The data is in list format but we need to change it into a tabular format. We also will use the select() function to reorganise the structure of the dataset.

```{r}
MC1_nodes <- as_tibble(MC1$nodes) %>%
  select(id, type, country)
```

```{r}
MC1_edges <- as_tibble(MC1$links) %>%
  select(source, target, type, weight, key)
